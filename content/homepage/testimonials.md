  <p>“Live/DEI coaching has quickly become irreplaceable in my life as a resource for working (and living!) in healthier and more balanced ways.”</p>

<div class="testimonial">
  <p>“Working with Live has been nothing short of transformative. She helped me take full ownership of the things I can control—how I respond to challenges, how I navigate adversity and to embrace my experiences with strength and clarity. For the first time in my career, someone has articulated my daily experience as a professional Black woman in a way that made me feel truly seen and validated.</p>

  <p>I’ve often felt dismissed or made to doubt my own thoughts and feelings, as though my experiences were being minimized or even erased. Live was the first person to tell me, “You’re not crazy,” with a depth of understanding that was profoundly healing. That acknowledgment was career-changing.</p>

  <p>I’ve been working for nearly 30 years, and transitioning into this new industry over a decade ago has been incredibly difficult to navigate. I can say with absolute certainty that Live’s support has been a gift. Her ability to create space for reflection, self-awareness, and growth has had a profound impact on me. I am deeply grateful for her wisdom, compassion, and the important work she is doing in this world.”</p>
