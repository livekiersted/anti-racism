I’m a **white woman who has been doing this work deeply for many years**. I don’t claim to understand the experience of being a person of color, but I **do** understand how whiteness operates—because I live it. I’ve done all the things white women do, and I’ve worked hard to see them clearly and move differently. The POC in my life have given me the **gift of honest feedback** about my whiteness, and that clarity has helped me recognize patterns as they arise, both in myself and in my clients.  

This work isn’t just something I do—it’s **deeply personal** to me. I love working with people for whom it’s personal too, whether it’s showing up in their relationships, workplace, leadership, or community. **I believe we each have a role to play in the lifelong struggle against racism**, and I help people find **their lane**—so they can move through it with clarity, integrity, and impact.  

My clients come to me when they need:  
- **Deep validation**—to hear *“You’re not crazy”* from someone who *gets it*.  
- **Sharp clarity**—to make sense of what’s happening beneath the surface, so they can move forward instead of spinning.  
- **Practical strategies**—that work in real-life relationships, workplaces, and leadership roles.  

I bring **deep compassion, clear-eyed honesty, and an unshakable belief in your capacity to navigate this**. I’ll care about you while also telling you the truth. I see power dynamics, I see patterns, and I make the invisible visible.  

**If you’re ready to move forward, we can figure this out together.**
