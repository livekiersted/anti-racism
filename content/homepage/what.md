Coaching & Strategy for White People, POC in White Spaces, and Organizations

If you're navigating the impact of white supremacyâ€”whether in your personal relationships, your workplace, or your leadership roleâ€”you donâ€™t have to do it alone.

I work with:

- **White people**â€”whether youâ€™re newly waking up or years in, I help you move past guilt, confusion, and overwhelm into clarity, action, and deepened integrity.
- **POC navigating white spaces**â€”decode the baffling, frustrating behaviors of white colleagues, bosses, and friends. Validate your experience, strategize next steps, and move through it with more ease.
- **Organizations & leadership**â€”from racially diverse teams struggling to function well together to DEI-minded leaders losing institutional support, I bring a clear lens to power dynamics, team culture, and what needs to shift.

This work can feel isolating, confusing, and discouraging. But clarity is possible. You can move from stuck to strategic, from alone to deeply connected, from overwhelmed to knowing exactly what needs to happen next. Letâ€™s figure it out together.
